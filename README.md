## time tracker

A very idiosyncratic time tracker. Almost certainly not useful to anyone who isn't me.

Started out as an elixir app (see the `elixir` branch), switched to ruby as elixir has no easy
equivalent to ruby's STDIN.getch (get a char in raw mode). Took the
opportunity to play around with https://github.com/ruby-concurrency/concurrent-ruby actors

#### Install
